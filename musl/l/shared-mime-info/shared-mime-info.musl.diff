+Searching for symbolic links:
+
+No symbolic links were found, so we won't make an installation script.
+You can make your own later in ./install/doinst.sh and rebuild the
+package if you like.
+
+This next step is optional - you can set the directories in your package
+to some sane permissions. If any of the directories in your package have
+special permissions, then DO NOT reset them here!
+
+Would you like to reset all directory permissions to 755 (drwxr-xr-x) and
+directory ownerships to root.root ([y]es, [n]o)? n
