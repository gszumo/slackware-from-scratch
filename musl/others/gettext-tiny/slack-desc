# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

gettext-tiny: symbols meant to be used together with the libintl built-in
gettext-tiny: into recent musl versions. The compatibility symbols help to
gettext-tiny: get past configure scripts that insist on using only the GNU
gettext-tiny: gettext suite. Additionally, it can be entirely disabled.
