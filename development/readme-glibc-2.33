from now -development directory is for glibc-2.33 and binutils-2.36 (patched) SFS building.
I began to clone glibc git repository and label it glibc-2.33.
I looked at : https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Release/2.33 to see what's deprecated or not working.
-------------------
- building tools is ok
- list1, list2, list3 ok
- 1552 built on 1552 and (2 failures + 2 solutions)
--------------------
qt5-webkit: builds ok with glibc-2.32 and binutils-2.36 with slackware, but not in SFS with glibc-2.33

solved (trick): disable gold in binutils before building qt5-webkit. Once Qt5-webkit installed, rebuild binutils with gold enabled.
A better solution would be to be enable to change ld.gold to ld.bfd during qt5-webkit.
-------------------
fcitx-libpinyin: nok with libpinyin-2.6.0-x86_64-1.txz, but ok with libpinyin-2.3.0-x86_64-2.txz

solution: upgrade to fcitx-libpinyin-0.5.4 which builds ok.
