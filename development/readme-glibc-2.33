from now -development directory is for glibc-2.33 SFS building.
I began to clone glibc git repository and label it glibc-2.33.
Looked at : https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Release/2.33 to see what's deprecated or not working.
-------------------
- building tools is ok
- list1, list2, list3 and list4 are ok (see list.diff)
- 1557 built on 1557 and 2 failures (solved)
-------------------
gst-plugins-base0: root cause make-4.3, ok with make-4.2.1
-------------------
found a solution to build gst-plugins-base0
-----------------------
gst-plugins-good0: root cause make-4.3, ok with make-4.2.1
-----------------------
found a solution to build gst-plugins-good0
--------------------
Everything builds fine with glibc-2.33.
Now it's time to include binutils-2.36.
