If you just to build a bare system able to boot you can use the scripts located
in the "mini-sfs" directory.
You have to rename them as:

# mv sfs-bootstrap-mini.sh sfs-bootstrap.sh
# mv sfs-tools-current-mini.sh sfs-tools-current.sh
# mv sfsbuild1-mini.sh sfsbuild1.sh

nota: You don't need the script: list_generator_c.sh it's embedded in
sfs-boostrap-mini.sh but only the list1 is included.
