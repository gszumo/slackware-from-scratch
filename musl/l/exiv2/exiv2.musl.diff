+Searching for symbolic links:
+usr/lib/libexiv2.so	libexiv2.so.27
+usr/lib/libexiv2.so.27	libexiv2.so.0.27.3
+
+Making symbolic link creation script:
+( cd usr/lib ; rm -rf libexiv2.so )
+( cd usr/lib ; ln -sf libexiv2.so.27 libexiv2.so )
+( cd usr/lib ; rm -rf libexiv2.so.27 )
+( cd usr/lib ; ln -sf libexiv2.so.0.27.3 libexiv2.so.27 )
+
+It is recommended that you make these lines your new installation script.
+
+Would you like to make this stuff the install script for this package
+and remove the symbolic links ([y]es, [n]o)? y
+
+
+Removing symbolic links:
+removed './usr/lib/libexiv2.so'
+removed './usr/lib/libexiv2.so.27'
+
+Creating your new ./install/doinst.sh...
+
+This next step is optional - you can set the directories in your package
+to some sane permissions. If any of the directories in your package have
+special permissions, then DO NOT reset them here!
+
+Would you like to reset all directory permissions to 755 (drwxr-xr-x) and
+directory ownerships to root.root ([y]es, [n]o)? n
